It was an invaluable learning experience that helped prepare me for my consulting career at Ernst & Young. Upon graduating, I also founded a technology startup and decided to engage CSC to help me with various tasks that included conducting market research, recommending product features, and assisting with marketing strategies. As both an alumnus and client, I highly recommend working with CSC to help your business achieve its goals.”</p>
